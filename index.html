           As another year circles around and your birthday arrives like a sparkling candle.Can you believe it's already been a year since we began this incredible journey together? It feels like yesterday we were just getting to know each other, and yet, it also feels like I've known you forever.I can't deny the hurt and confusion our breakup caused.

There's no point in sugarcoating it - I messed up. I missed your [positive quality] nature, and your [positive quality] spirit felt like a missing piece in my life. Every day was a dull echo without you by my side, and the distance only amplified the ache.

But sometimes, even the biggest mistakes can become stepping stones. We've both learned and grown through this experience, and coming back together has shown me just how much our love truly means.Today, on your birthday, I don't just want to apologize, I want to promise you something real. I promise to fight for us, to cherish every moment we have, and to never take your presence for granted again.Happy birthday, my love. This year, and every year after, is a chance for us to build a stronger, brighter future together.

With all my love, genuine apology, and unwavering commitment,
<br/>
[Ayoub]
